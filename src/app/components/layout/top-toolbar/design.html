      ElderDrug.com is an Angular project aimed at making Beers Criteria more
      accessible to students and providers. Rather than having to search through
      a PDF, Elder Drug allows multiple drugs to be searched in a single query.
      Elder Drug expands index terms to include brands and generics for all
      entries, even those that only specify a class or therapeutic category
      (e.g. 'Antipsychotics' would include 'aripiprazole' and 'Abilify').
      <br />
      Many drugs in this database have been determined by querying
      Class/Therapeutic Category members (e.g. Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors), and
      the resulting generic RxCUIs are used to query brand names. The resulting
      database consists of thousands of drugs, so I cannot guarantee accuracy
      for all entries. However, I will continue to test and fix any issues as
      they arise.
