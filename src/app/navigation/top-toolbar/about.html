      Elderdrug.com was created to make the AGS Beers Criteria easier to search.
      It uses RxNORM for drug data, Firebase for hosting, and Angular for
      front-end design. Many drugs in this database have been determined by
      querying Class/Therapeutic Category members (e.g. Cyclooxygenase
      Inhibitors), and using the resulting generic RxCUIs to query brand names.
      This generates thousands of drugs, so I cannot guarantee accuracy for all
      entries. However, I will continue to test and fix any issues as they
      arise.

      If you'd like to get in touch regarding additions, errors, changes, or
      programming as a pharmacy student, email me at david_hicks@unc.edu. I love
      talking technology, which my classmates will attest to.

      Last, I want to thank Dr. Shannon Rice and Dr. Tasha Woodall at the
      Mountain Area Health Education Center for giving me this idea and
      encouraging me to learn more about programming, and all of my professors,
      friends and family, my kitty, and my girlfriend for listening to me talk
      about programming for the past few months &#128517;.
