      ElderDrug.com is an Angular project that makes it easier to search Beers
      Criteria. Rather than having to search through a PDF, Elder Drug allows
      multiple drugs to be searched in a single query. Additionally, Elder Drug
      expands index terms to include brands and generics for all entries, even
      those that only specify a class or therapeutic category (e.g.
      'Antipsychotics' would include 'aripiprazole' and 'Abilify'). Many drugs
      in this database have been determined by querying Class/Therapeutic
      Category members (e.g. Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors), and using the resulting
      generic RxCUIs to query brand names. The resulting database consists of
      thousands of drugs, so I cannot guarantee accuracy for all entries.
      However, I will continue to test and fix any issues as they arise.
